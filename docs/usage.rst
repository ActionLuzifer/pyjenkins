	 <JobSummary my-other-project>]

	>>> # get a job instance

	>>> # Trigger a build.
	>>> # The job must be configured with 'trigger builds remotely'
	>>> build = job.build('token string')

	>>> # builds take a bit to start. Call 'refresh()' to update from the API
	>>> build.started
	False
	>>> # wait a bit
	>>> build.refresh()
	>>> build.started()
	True
	>>> # how long will the build take (in milliseconds)?
	>>> build.estimated_duration
	60588
